# Climbing-App-HCI-Project

A mobile app prototype for outdoor rock climbers, developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework project.

## üöÄ About the Project

This project focuses on building a user-friendly and accessible mobile app designed for outdoor rock climbers. The app includes features like:
- **Climb Logging**: Record essential details such as climbing locations, difficulty, and personal notes.
- **Weather Updates**: Receive real-time weather forecasts tailored to climbing locations.
- **Community Engagement**: Connect with other climbers through activity feeds, group chats, and collaborative challenges.

### Key Features
- Gamification elements (badges, leaderboards) to encourage engagement.
- Adaptive design with Dark Mode for low-light conditions.
- Integration with wearable devices for real-time safety notifications.
